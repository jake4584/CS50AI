# CS50AI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my coursework and projects for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Course Overview

CS50AI explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation.

## Projects

### Lecture 0: Search
- **[Degrees](Lecture0/degrees/)** - A program that finds the shortest path between any two actors using the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](Lecture0/tictactoe/)** - An AI that plays optimal Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Various AI/ML libraries and algorithms
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)
- Game theory and Minimax

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own specific requirements and instructions. Navigate to the individual project directories for more details on how to run each program.
